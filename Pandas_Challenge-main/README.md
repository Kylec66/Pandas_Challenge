Conclusions

Three conclusions that I can make based on the data from this script are that the majority 
of the players are between the ages of 15-29 making up 76% of the user base. 
The second conlcusion would be that males were the majority of purchases and also had a 
much larger avergae of total purchases per person. The Third conclusion I can make from the
data would be that the item with the largest purchase count was also the most expensive item 
for people to purchase.
